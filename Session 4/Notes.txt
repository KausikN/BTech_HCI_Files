Usability
 - Input Format
 - Feedback (Accuracy and Speed) (Searching should finish fast and should be accurate)
 - Visibility
 - Affordance (Door affords opening)
 - Visibility (Control-Effect Mapping for features) (Steering Wheel -> Rotate it to turn vehicle)

Bad Usability
 - TV Remotes
 - User Manuals
 - User Agreements

Good Usability
 - Chatbots

Golden Theory - Blame the Design, Not the User
